Flexbox
  justify-content: along the x axis
  align-content: along the y axis

  put div2 into div1 so that div2 can be made relative to div1 instead of the container as a whole
  divide stuff into different columns and then into another container

  can use recursive concept (like with lists) on boxes
  make into followers/children 
    To make overlapping cascading boxes
    .followers
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;

          Main axis
