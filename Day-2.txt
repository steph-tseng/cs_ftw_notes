Review: 
  Web
  Internet
  URL
  HTML
  CSS
  JS
  Front end (client-side)
  Back end (server-side)

CLI (command line interface) vs GUI (graphical user interface)

Common CLIs
  cd - change directory; which folder is being edited
  Relative path
  Absolute path

Git
  check git status to see if the changes have registered
  "git add ." to add any changes to the stage
  git commit -m "title" to save any changes
  push origin main to push it back to the repository
  Git pull is the opposite of push and copies edits from the online repository to the local hard drive 

CSS
  Cascading style sheet
  Inline style
  Ex. <p style=”color”: red; 
  CSS code inside of an html document
  Separate document (convention because less confusing)
  Em is a relative size for the kid to have a size relative to the parent’s (rem is relative)
  Specificity: the most specific rule is the one that will be applied (ie. ID vs all headings)
  With the keyword “important” it can override everything

Origin
  Important user > user CSS > browser
